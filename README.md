This game is called Foliage Fantasy and is meant as a fun, relaxing gardening game!

Using the mouse, you have to slick and drag to the side in order to scroll the page left and right.
You play as the character and you can create a garden by plotting recursive trees. The game has a few available mounds of dirt, plots, for the player to plant, water, and destory the trees.
There are three buttons the player can use. The first one being a Seed Button, in which the player would be able to plant seeds in the plots to start the process of growing a tree. The next function would be the Water Button which would allow the player to water the seeds and help the tree grow. Lastly, the last function would be the Shovel Button, in which the player would be able to remove any current tree to grow a new one.

Roles:
Janely N. M.- my role for this project was creating the background design and editing images for the project. I created the background in layers in order for the parallax effect to work effectively. I also had to create the background with the right size and pixels.

Jade Inderbitzen- I input the sound into the game; the button, shovel, water, and seed effect. I also found the background music online and implemented that too. I helped finalize the water particles as well as the parallax effect on the background. I also created the different modes for the buttons so they do what they were supposed to do when selected. My role was to finalize things and make sure they are complete and "perfect". (https://www.free-stock-music.com/fsm-team-happy-days.html)

Brendan Taubert- I designed the sound effects you hear in game from start to finish using various textures I sampled, recorded, or synthesized and processed them accordingly. Then I equalized the levels of the different sounds so they are all approximately the same volume in game.

Arthur Gan - I adapted the recursive tree sample from https://processing.org/examples/tree.html to have have a more random appearance, including size, angle, and color. I also made modifications so that it would "grow" over time.
